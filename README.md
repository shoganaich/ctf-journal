## üìö What‚Äôs Inside

- **Writeups:** Detailed step-by-step investigations, findings, and flag walkthroughs for each CTF or incident.
- **KQL Logs:** All the raw query experiments, pivots, and iterations‚Äîso you see what worked and what didn‚Äôt.
- **Templates:** My personal format for keeping writeups consistent and useful (see [`_templates/CTF-writeup-template.md`](./_templates/CTF-writeup-template.md)).
- **Lessons Learned:** Honest reflections and takeaways from every challenge.
