## 📚 What’s Inside

- **Writeups:** Detailed step-by-step investigations, findings, and flag walkthroughs for each CTF or incident.
- **KQL Logs:** All the raw query experiments, pivots, and iterations—so you see what worked and what didn’t.
- **Templates:** My personal format for keeping writeups consistent and useful (see [`_templates/CTF-writeup-template.md`](./_templates/CTF-writeup-template.md)).
- **Lessons Learned:** Honest reflections and takeaways from every challenge.

## 🤔 Why This Repo?

- To sharpen my blue team, SOC, and threat hunting skills through hands-on practice.
- To document the real process—failed hunts, “aha!” moments, and learning pivots.
- To help fellow learners and my future self find practical blue team references.
- To make investigations more repeatable (and less mysterious!).
